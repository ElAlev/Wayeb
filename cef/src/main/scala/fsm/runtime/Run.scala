/**
  * Class representing an automaton run.
  *
  * @param id The id of the run.
  * @param fsm The automaton corresponding to the run.
  * @param conf The configuration from which the run is to start (useful when cloning non-deterministic runs, in which
  *             case a cloned run must start from a possibly non-start state and with specific register contents).
  * @param runningMatch The currently detected partial match.
  * @param counter Each run must count the number of events it has processed. This counter is useful for forecasting,
  *                since it is used to generate the forecast intervals. These are produced with reference to this
  *                counter. The counter is also used with windowed automata to ensure that a match does not violate the
  *                window constraint. For new runs, the counter is set initially by default to 0. For cloned runs,
  *                the initial counter must be set with the same value as the counter of the original run.
  * @param checkForEmitting A special flag for determining how to emit forecasts. If true, the event must have an
  *                         "isEmitting" attribute and this determines whether we are allowed to emit a forecast or not.
  * @param distance A parameter (Tuple2, (minDistance,maxDistance)) that determines when forecasts should be emitted.
  *
  *                 If minDistance==maxDistance==-1, forecasts are emitted eagerly, whenever possible (i.e., whenever
  *                 the current state of a FSM can provide a valid forecast, forecast interval satisfying the confidence
  *                 threshold and max spread constraints).
  *
  *                 If minDistance!=-1 and minDistance < 1.0 (same for maxDistance), then forecasts are emitted only
  *                 from states whose remaining percentage is between minDistance and maxDistance.
  *                 The remaining percentage of a state is the ratio of its shortest path length to a final divided by
  *                 the maximum shortest path from all states. It gives an estimate of how close a state is to
  *                 completion. A remaining percentage of 0.0 means that the automaton is in a final state. A
  *                 remaining percentage of 1.0 means that it is in one of its start states.
  *
  *                 If minDistance!=-1 and minDistance >= 1.0 (same for maxDistance), forecasts are emitted only when
  *                 the current event's timestamp has a temporal distance from the next CE in the stream that is equal
  *                 to the value of the parameter.
  *                 CAUTION: This setting (with distances>=1.0) should be used only when one pattern is provided via
  *                 fsmProvider. Does not work for multiple patterns. Moreover, the input stream must have been
  *                 pre-processed so that each input event has an extra attribute, called "nextCETimestamp", providing
  *                 the timestamp of the next CE. See fsm.runtime.Run#isEmitting(stream.GenericEvent).
  * @param show Determines whether complex event matches and forecasts are to be displayed or not.
  *

  // of a PSA as usual, with the addition of some extra states. These states, viewed as states
  // of a Markov chain, are transient. This means that the automaton will move through these
  // states for some transitions, but it will finally end into the states of the PSA, stay in that
  // class and never return to any of the transient states. In fact, if the automaton starts in any
  // of the transient states, then it will enter the single, recurrent class of the PSA in at most
  // mmax transitions. Given the fact that in our work we deal with streams of infinite length, it
  // is certain that, while reading a stream, the automaton will have entered the PSA after at
  // most mmax symbols. Thus, instead of checking this condition, we prefer to simply construct
  // only the PSA and wait (for at most mmax symbols) until the first m â‰¤ mmax symbols of a
